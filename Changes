Revision history for Pod-Coverage-TrustMe

  - release as stable
  - remove unused _CvGV method which was explicitly documented as not existing
  - fix covered and uncovered methods to return empty lists when no symbols
    are present
  - ignore all subs that are not identifiers. they are not callable with
    normal syntax, so they should only be for internal use.
  - internal refactoring for easier extension
  - rename trust_imported to ignore_imported since the imported subs are
    excluded from the symbol list, not included in the covered list
